# Enigma vs Turing Bombe

Implementation for Enigma and Turing Bombe

## Enigma

To run enigma simply type
```
$ ./bin/enigma Hello World
```

You can reconfigure your Enigma running
```
$ ./bin/configure
```
This will destroy existing config and create new one. If you want your friend to be able to decrypt your message, you should share your config with him _secretly_.

## Bombe

TBD.
